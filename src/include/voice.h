/// Class Voice represents a sample that is currently playing through
/// the PCM device. (Class Sample represents the static portion of a
/// sample.)  Mezzo, at launch time, pre-allocate 512 voices that will
/// be associated to samples dynamically when a new sound will be
/// required to be played. The number of pre-allocated voices can be
/// easily changed in the Poly class definition (poly.h).
///
/// A voice (an instance of the class Voice), during its life, goes
/// through a variety of states that enable the synchronization of
/// events that occurs in 4 concurrent threads:
///
///  o Midi callback processing (when a user interact with the
///    keyboard)
///
///  o PCM callback processing (when the PCM device requires new sound
///    data)
///
///  o In the Samples Feeder thread (when its time to feed new sample
///    data in the FIFO buffer)
///
/// As you may have inferred, the Voice class is at the center of the
/// activities allowing the generation of sounds to be sent to the PCM
/// device.
///
/// The main duty of an instance of this class is to supply sound data
/// from a single Sample object to the Poly::mixer method in bundles of
/// 256 samples. When a voice is first activated, it starts by
/// supplying samples that have been pre-loaded at the time the Samples
/// class has been instantiated (at program startup or when a new
/// Preset is loaded). This will give (hopefully)
/// sufficient time to background threads to
/// start to feed a FIFO (First In, First Out) buffer.  At the end of
/// the pre-loaded samples buffer, the instance will then start to read
/// data from the FIFO until the end of the sample or a request by the
/// user (through MIDI) to stop a note being played.
///
/// Class Poly will retrieve samples buffer from voices to build
/// frames. A frame contains two float values, one for each side of a
/// stereophonic sound. The PCM device is programmed to require 44100
/// frames per second. A bundle will supply ~5.8ms (256 / 44100) of
/// data to the PCM device. Once a request is received by the
/// application, the maximum latency to produce changes is then less
/// than or equal to 5.8ms (A note is requested by the user: at the
/// time the note is struck on the keyboard, there is already a
/// bundle being played, a second bundle is in preparation by Mezzo,
/// the note tricked will be taken into account no later than in the
/// next bundle to be prepared).
///
/// As is often the case, a Samples Library maybe lacking some of the
/// notes required to fulfill the entire keyboard keys. This class
/// allow for scaling of notes to reflect the pitch of the targeted
/// note.
///
/// \section VoiceDetails On the dynamics of the Voice Class
///
/// The following state diagram presents the various states through
/// which a voice is going through when a sound is required to be
/// played.
///
/// \startuml
///     [*] -down-> Inactive
///
///     state Inactive {
///       [*] -down-> DORMANT
///       CLOSING -up-> DORMANT
///       CLOSING : FadeOut completed
///       DORMANT : Voice is not in use
///     }
///     state Active {
///       OPENING -down-> ALIVE
///       OPENING : A Sample is attached to the voice
///       OPENING : Pre-loaded PCM data supplied to mixer
///       ALIVE : Fifo filled continuously
///       ALIVE : SamplesFeeder thread is in charge
///       ALIVE : noteOff... FadeOut activated
///     }
///
///     DORMANT -right-> OPENING : (Voice activated)
///     ALIVE   -left-> CLOSING : (FadeOut complete)
///     OPENING --> CLOSING : (FadeOut complete)
/// \enduml
///
/// A voice will be played only when its global state is ACTIVE. At
/// startup, all voices are DORMANT and INACTIVE.  When a sound is
/// requested, a voice is activated by associating it to a sample and
/// changing its state to OPENING and ACTIVE. The state is changed
/// to ALIVE. The FIFO associated with the voice is then being feed
/// by the SamplesFeeding thread. When a request is made to stop to
/// play a voice, the sound is fade out, diminishing its volume to
/// zero for the next second or the end of the sample data if it comes
/// before. When fade out is complete, the voice states is then put as
/// INACTIVE and CLOSING.
///
/// Fade out processing is done by the Poly::mixer() method, as it
/// implies an optimization on computations done with the ARM NEON
/// intrinsic instructions.
